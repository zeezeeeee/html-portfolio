<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Zaburat Olajide. I am a 25 year old aspiring Web Developer. 
  I have a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice: Law Enforcement & Technology. I have been trying to start my career in techology for a while now and I hope this is the break I need.</p>

<p>I am the oldest daughter of 4 children and I have three younger brothers whom I adore. My goal with the switch in my career is to able to enhance my skills and also earn the freedom that comes with making a better income.
  I want to be able to take care of my parents and siblings and show them the finer things in life. I also would like to explore what life has to offer for myself and travel to different countries. 
</p>

<p>From creating this website/ portfolio, I aspire to be able to showcase my growth and skills to possible future employers. I hope that this website would allow recruiters, employers, and companies to give me a fair chance 
  to add value to their company. I am hoping to become the best Web Developer there can be. A few things I would like to create are apps for my favorite skincare brands, websites for friends, and possibly a website for my own future business.
